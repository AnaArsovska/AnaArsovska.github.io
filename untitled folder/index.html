	Our guide dogs give people with vision loss the independence they need to live life to its fullest. Our service dogs give veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and other disabilities the help they need to emerge from seclusion and overcome anxiety. Our dogs also serve veterans as emotional support dogs and facility therapy dogs. And our skilled companion dogs give hope to children facing significant challenges such as vision loss (Kids Companion dogs, guide dogs for teens) or the loss of a parent in the military (Gold Star Family dogs).
